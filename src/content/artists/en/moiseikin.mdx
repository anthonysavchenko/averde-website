The Moiseikin Jewelry House was founded in 1993 by Viktor Moiseikin, who takes inspiration from Fabergé traditions and the jewelry of the Silver Age, blending Eastern and Western aesthetics. The brand is known for its style, elegance, and innovation, using natural gemstones such as diamonds, pearls, opals, and Ural gems.

The special Waltzing Brilliance® technology allows gemstones to move in their settings, creating a “dancing” effect. Moiseikin holds over 20 patents and has received international awards, including the International Jewellery Design Excellent Award and a Gokhran prize. His works are exhibited in museums across Russia, China, Dubai, and other countries. In 2023, the company celebrated its 30th anniversary, and in 2024, Moiseikin was named one of the top 15 designers at Jewellery & Gem World Hong Kong.
