An ambassador of Russian contemporary art and one of the few sculptors working with rare gaharu wood. He discovered this material in Bali, where he created art with support from the royal family. According to the artist, his works bring harmony to space, and his concept “WoodJazz” combines craftsmanship and sacred knowledge.

Balan creates sculptures from exotic woods such as gaharu, ebony, macassar, rosewood, teak, and mahogany, often adding metal or glass. He calls his method “wise sculpture” — the art of removing the unnecessary.

His works are in the collections of Sergey Shoigu, Rustam Minnikhanov, Nikita Mikhalkov, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Ilya Lagutenko, and royal families of Jordan and Indonesia. Balan Gallery projects are located in hotels and residences in France, England, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the USA.
