Russian artist and painter working in the style of expressionism. She studied at the Moscow Academic Art School in Memory of 1905 under Viktor Sedov and Vladimir Karandaev, where she learned the basics of academic art and began to form her own style.

In 2024, she took part in 15 exhibitions, 6 of which were solo shows — an important step in her career. Her paintings are kept in Russian museum collections such as the Yesenin Museum (Yesenin Center) and the Museum of Cosmonautics at VDNH, as well as in private collections around the world.

She is a member of the Creative Union of Artists of Russia and co-founder of SAS Art Gallery. Elkina is known for her unique artistic language that shows different sides of modern art and gives her images deep emotional power. She often writes poems to accompany her paintings, joining painting and poetry together.
