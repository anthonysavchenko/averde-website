Valery and Natalia Cherkashina have worked together since 1983. They began with painting and photography, later moving into installations, digital media, and, in recent years, collaborations with artificial intelligence.

Their projects include “The Cherkashin Metropolitan Museum”, performances in the Moscow Metro, experiments with inflation and secret voting, “Global Underground”, and art-sport projects. Their works are in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, SFMOMA, Boston MFA, the Russian Museum, the Hermitage, and the Pushkin Museum. They have held over 200 exhibitions and 270 performances around the world and have lectured at Harvard, Berkeley, Columbia, and Princeton. Inspired by our project, the Cherkashins are presenting painting for the first time in twenty years — as a new energy breakthrough.
