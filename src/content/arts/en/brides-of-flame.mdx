The painting shows the gas industry as a woman crowned with glowing shapes like blue fire. The thick texture of the canvas changes with the light, showing shades from deep blue to golden tones. It feels like living energy.

Gas is shown as the «blue fuel» the partner of oil. Together they are the base of hydrocarbon civilization. Oil represents the earth’s power; gas is its «other half» the fire rising to the sky. Together they symbolize strength and fragility, wealth and contradiction in the energy age.
