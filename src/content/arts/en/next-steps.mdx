The history of energy is a canvas of light and shadow. For years, it was built on oil, gas, and coal. But now, new clean energy sources are entering the picture — wind, nuclear, and hydrogen. Together they form a complex but beautiful balance.

The future of energy is like a chess game. Every move is a search for harmony. The goal is not to win, but to find balance and create a perfect composition for future generations.
