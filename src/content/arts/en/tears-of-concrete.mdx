Water is energy. It gives life to everything. People have always tried to control its power and use it for light and heat. The building of hydroelectric stations began a new age of water energy.

The artist shows the strength of water released from a dam. The movement of water is turned into a three-dimensional shape that looks alive. Using metallization, the artist joins painting and sculpture. The work shows not only memories of great construction projects, but also the connection between humans and nature.
