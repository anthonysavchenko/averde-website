Wind has always inspired people. It moved mills and later lifted airplanes. Now, it has become a source of clean energy. Wind turbines around the world are like white beacons of change.

Wind connects nature and humans, technology and space. It is a bridge between wild power and creative energy — the breath of the planet turned into energy and art.
