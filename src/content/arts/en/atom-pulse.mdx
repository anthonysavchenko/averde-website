The painting shows the rhythm of the 80-year history of the nuclear industry. It combines the energy of discovery, the strain of challenges, and the strength of science.

The pulse symbolizes both a reactor’s work and the heartbeat of the industry. The atom here means clean, low-carbon energy. The contrast of light and shadow shows both the risks and the resilience of this field.
