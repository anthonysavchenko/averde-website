People don’t join the oil industry by accident. It finds us — like a first glance, a first meeting, a first love. We fall in love with its shapes and lines. This love turns into passion, and passion leads to movement. Movement creates new forms, and forms reflect their time.

In this flame, new ideas and discoveries are born — they inspire both the artist and the oil and gas industry itself.
