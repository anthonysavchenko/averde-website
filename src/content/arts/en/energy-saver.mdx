The fuel and energy complex is a set of industries that include the fuel industry (production of oil, gas, coal and other fuels), the electric power industry (production and distribution of electricity), as well as enterprises engaged in the transportation and distribution of fuel and energy.

All these industries are interconnected and form a single whole to ensure reliable energy supply to the country.

The three-headed fire-breathing dragon identifies itself as the Russian fuel and energy complex in difficult geopolitical conditions, but not broken by any obstacles and continuing to move on its own path.
