Power lines are a complex, harmonious system — a single energy organism. Invisible streams of electrons flow like rivers, bringing power to every part of the country.

Their movement may look chaotic but follows exact physical laws. Energy workers face new challenges every day, but their mastery keeps the system stable and strong. The flow of energy is both scientific and beautiful, revealing the harmony of nature’s laws.
