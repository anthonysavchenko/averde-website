Have you ever noticed how beautiful power lines look at sunset? Their tall steel shapes and stretched wires turn golden in the last sunlight, as if coming to life. At that moment, this engineering structure becomes something poetic and majestic.

The power lines, wild nature, and sunset form a mysterious harmony. It is a natural work of art created by both people and nature. This beauty must be preserved so that future generations can admire it too.
