The painting shows the coal industry as a union between people and the resource. The miners form a pyramid that symbolizes families and generations working in mining towns. Their faces are hidden, because they work not for fame but for the future — for the light and warmth others will receive.

Coal is shown not only as “black gold,” but as a symbol of strength and teamwork. The link between people and coal becomes a story of hard work, where warmth and comfort are mined from deep underground.
