  <h1>AVerdizm</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Energy</strong> is not only the foundation of civilization but also a
    special kind of beauty — grand, strict, and almost sacred. This beauty hides
    where it seems there is no place for poetry — in the giant shapes of power plants,
    in the glowing lines of wires, and in the mechanical breath of machines that
    give people light and warmth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the beginning of industrialization, artists have been inspired by the
    power and severe beauty of large engineering structures — those that produce
    and transport electricity or extract and process natural resources. In
    Soviet industrial realism, artists showed the heroic work of builders,
    engineers, and scientists who created the energy strength of the country and
    laid the foundation for modern Russia’s power.

    Today a new era has come — <strong
      >the era of sustainable development</strong
    >. It requires not only new technologies but also a fresh artistic
    understanding of energy and the changes happening in this field.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>AVerdizm</strong> is a creative community that creates artistic images
    of the energy industry. Its goal is to show the greatness and beauty of energy
    structures, reveal the unique forms made by bold engineering ideas, and express
    the special charm of wind, water, and light — in lines, spirals, and flashes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mission of <strong>AVerdizm</strong> is to connect artists and energy professionals,
    to build a bridge between industrial power and imagination — where power lines
    become brushstrokes, the glow of turbines turns into rhythms of light on canvas,
    and the heartbeat of power stations becomes poetry in color.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>AVerdizm art platform</strong> was born in Russia and continues to
    unite energy and art internationally — within the UN, BRICS, and SCO spaces.
